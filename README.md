# Consolidated Desci Supergraph

- built on [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh/v1/getting-started)

- uses the IPSeed Mainnet subgraph as base. Adds catalyst's project id api as endpoint to fetch project data ("imagine this is ipfs").  

- adds a plain *sample* file (see `jsons`) now to derive a graphql schema. This works far better with [JSON schema](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh/v1/source-handlers/json-schema). Which we can generate from our Zod Schema!

- everything required in `mesh.config.ts`

- `supergraph.graphql` is **autogenerated**

## Commands


### build / run locally
`npx mesh-compose -o supergraph.graphql`
`npx hive-gateway supergraph`

### deploy

`gcloud run deploy --source .`

Q

- How do build more complex "resolver" logic here (stripping the schema prefix from the projectId root field?)
